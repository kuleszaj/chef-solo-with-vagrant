# chef

This directory contains the `solo.rb` file which is used to configure chef solo. It ensures that chef looks in both `cookbooks` and `site-cookbooks` when executing.

This directory also contains JSON files which specify the run list for a given chef run.  The names of the JSON files correspond to the stages for which the file will be used.
